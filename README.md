# Matomo CampaignVisitorsByTime Plugin

## Description

This plugin aggregates visitors per campaign/keyword in a more detailed interval of 15 minutes. 

We use it for getting analysis values in the Fundraising Operation Center,
querying the Matomo API. If you want to see the widget in Matomo, go to
